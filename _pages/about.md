I'm Che-Chih (哲志), an avid hiker, backpacker and mycologist. My research interests are in the areas of Fungal Diversity and Ecology. My PhD topic is the Systematic study of aphyllophoroid genera Ceriporia, Paratrichaptum, Phanerochaete and Xylodon in East Asia. Besides, I work on the taxonomy of corticioid and polyporoid fungi, especially the mycoflora in Taiwan. Any opportunity for collaboration is welcome.
